Performance Measure Overview – Simplified
1. Core Profitability Metrics
Margin PnL
Formula: Margin PnL = Daily Market Making PnL - Slippage PnL
Reflects profit after accounting for slippage risks.
Daily Market Making PnL
Profit from market-making activities before slippage.
Formula: Margin PnL + Slippage PnL
Slippage PnL
Loss due to delta risk from CBBC positions.
2. Delta Hedging PnL
Purpose:
Offset slippage from CBBCs.
Manage inventory risk without taking directional market bets.
Key Principles:
Risk-neutral: Only hedge existing delta exposure.
No speculation: Focus is on minimizing slippage.
End-of-Day Flattening: Always close delta positions by day end to eliminate overnight risk.
Cross-Hedging: Use sector-correlated stocks when primary stock is flat.
Cost Control: Avoid unnecessary stamp duty fees.
Decision Factors:
Orderflow, price action, volume, inventory, technical & sentiment analysis.
Outcome:
Positive: Delta Hedging PnL ≥ Slippage PnL → Effective hedging.
Negative: Limited loss due to conservative execution.
Goal: Capture >90% of Margin PnL.
3. Daily Net PnL
Formula: Daily Market Making PnL + Delta Hedging PnL
Represents total daily profitability.
4. Margin / X Management PnL
Formula:
Margin/X Management PnL = Net Quantity × (Margin – Margin at Start of Day)
Net Quantity: Positive for buys, negative for sells.
Purpose & Use Cases:
Measures profitability from managing flow, especially with delta and latency arbitrageurs.
Helps assess margin dynamics, pricing strategy effectiveness, and inventory turnover.
Advantages:
Captures how effective the team is at adjusting margins to capture flow and profit.
Provides insights into flow quality and market responsiveness.
Limitations & Challenges:
Price Inelasticity Assumption:
Assumes the same volume could be sold at start-of-day margin — often unrealistic due to:
Market competition
Demand fluctuations
Trading behavior of participants
Impact of Margin Adjustments:
Lowering margin mid-day may increase sales and total PnL, even if margin PnL looks reduced.
Penalizes competitive pricing strategies that aim to gain volume or market share.
Selling More = Penalized:
Selling greater volume at lower margins (due to competition) gets penalized under this model, even if it increases actual profit.
Doesn’t account for strategic margin reductions to offset slippage and gap risks.
Key Insight:
Margin/X Management PnL is useful for flow analysis, but should not be the sole performance metric. It must be viewed alongside realized PnL and risk-adjusted returns.
5. Selective Delta Hedging Strategy
This strategy ensures optimal delta management while maximizing margin capture and minimizing unnecessary costs.
Guiding Principle:
Delta hedge only when it benefits overall PnL, especially in products where hedging doesn't hurt margins.
A. Avoid Hedging High-Retail Participation Products
Why?
Retail traders are less price-sensitive, allowing for higher margins.
Hedging these products may require lowering margins, reducing profitability.
Impact:
Preserves high-margin levels.
Avoids unnecessary margin erosion.
B. Prefer Hedging Price-Elastic Products
Characteristics:
High vol-arb or institutional participation.
More sensitive to price changes.
Easier to adjust delta positions without significant margin impact.
Benefits:
Efficient delta adjustment.
Minimal penalty to margin/X PnL.
Better balance between risk management and margin preservation.
C. Strategic Outcome
Optimizes Margin Capture:
Keeps high-margin products untouched.
Applies hedging where it’s most cost-effective.
Improves Risk Control:
Manages slippage and inventory risks without sacrificing profitability.
Supports Flow Strategy:
Aligns hedging with market participant behavior for better execution and results.

5. Selective Delta Hedging Strategy
Avoid Hedging High-Retail Products:
These have high margins; hedging could harm profitability.
Prefer Hedging Price-Elastic Products:
Easier to adjust deltas without impacting margins.
Minimizes slippage and enhances margin capture.

6. Key Takeaways & Recommendations
Use Multiple Metrics:
Margin/X PnL offers flow insights but isn't sufficient alone.
Focus on Realized Profits:
Assess actual profits after slippage, margin changes, and flow dynamics.
Adopt an Integrated View:
Combine Margin PnL, Delta Hedging PnL, and Daily Net PnL for holistic performance tracking.

6. Key Takeaways & Recommendations
This section synthesizes the insights from the various metrics into a practical framework for evaluating and enhancing trading performance.

1. Adopt a Holistic Performance Framework
No single metric is sufficient:
Each metric (Margin PnL, Delta Hedging PnL, Margin/X Management PnL) captures different dimensions of performance.
Integrated Evaluation:
Use Daily Net PnL for overall profitability.
Use Margin PnL for understanding slippage efficiency.
Use Delta Hedging PnL to assess risk management effectiveness.
Use Margin/X Management PnL for pricing and flow strategy evaluation.
Why this matters:
This multidimensional view helps avoid misleading conclusions and ensures that short-term gains do not compromise long-term risk-adjusted performance.
2. Focus on Realized Profitability Over Theoretical Models
Go beyond Margin/X Management PnL assumptions:
Challenge the price inelasticity assumption (i.e., assuming same volumes can be sold at start-of-day margins).
Recognize that real-world market behavior, competition, and demand elasticity often require margin flexibility.
Better performance indicators:
Compare margins sold vs. margins bought back (realized spread).
Evaluate if slippage and gap risks were adequately covered.
Track margin retention rate (percentage of quoted margin captured as profit).
Outcome:
More accurate reflection of trading decisions and execution quality.
Avoid penalizing profitable actions that lower theoretical PnL but optimize actual returns.
3. Strategic Flow & Risk Management
Selectively apply delta hedging:
Hedge where it’s cost-efficient, especially in price-elastic products.
Preserve high-margin opportunities by avoiding unnecessary hedging in retail-heavy flows.
Align inventory and margin strategy:
Use delta hedging not just for risk control, but to enhance margin capture by stabilizing inventory and enabling more consistent pricing.
Consider sector correlations for cross-hedging to minimize stamp duty and optimize hedging costs.
Balance turnover vs. margin:
In competitive markets, slightly lower margins may increase turnover and net PnL.
Be willing to accept lower margin per contract if it leads to better flow quality and higher total profit.
4. Continuous Performance Refinement
Regularly review hedging effectiveness:
Compare slippage PnL vs. Delta Hedging PnL to validate strategy.
Aim for delta hedging PnL ≥ slippage PnL to ensure effective execution.
Monitor competitive positioning:
Track how margin changes influence volume, market share, and client behavior.
Adjust margin dynamically to balance profitability, competitiveness, and inventory risk.
Leverage data-driven tools:
Use analytics to monitor:
Real-time margin capture
Inventory exposure
Slippage trends
Trade execution quality
5. Final Recommendation: Performance = Profitability + Risk Control
True performance isn’t just about gross PnL — it’s about:
How profit is generated (via smart margining and flow strategy)
How risk is managed (via disciplined delta hedging)
How sustainable the approach is (through inventory stability and client behavior)
By combining margin discipline, delta control, and market responsiveness, you build a performance framework that is:
Robust
Scalable
Resilient to market volatility

Capture greater market share
Maintain competitive standing among top dealers
Maximize profitability without compromising on risk control
6. Passive market-making is fundamentally flow-driven. Its success hinges on the presence of sufficient natural client activity
