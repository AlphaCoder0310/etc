When working with financial asset return data, outsized moves (outliers) are common due to the nature of the data, such as market shocks or extreme price movements. 

Winsorizing can be a useful technique to reduce the influence of such outliers and make the residuals closer to a normal distribution, which is one of the key assumptions of OLS regression.

1. Typical Winsorization Levels
Common thresholds for winsorizing financial data are at the 1st and 99th percentiles or 5th and 95th percentiles of the data.
1% Winsorization (1st and 99th percentiles): Mild adjustment that retains most of the data's characteristics but trims extreme outliers.
5% Winsorization (5th and 95th percentiles): More aggressive adjustment that reduces the influence of a larger set of extreme values.
The choice between 1% and 5% depends on how heavy-tailed your data is. Financial returns often exhibit fat tails (leptokurtosis), so larger adjustments (like 5%) may sometimes be necessary.

2. Empirical Rule for Normality
To assess how much to winsorize, you can:

Compute the z-scores of your data to identify how far each observation deviates from the mean in terms of standard deviations.
Based on the empirical rule:
Approximately 99.7% of data from a normal distribution falls within ±3 standard deviations.
Winsorizing anything beyond ±3 standard deviations is often reasonable.
For financial data, you may also consider ±4 or ±5 standard deviations to account for the fat tails, but this depends on how much deviation from normality you are willing to accept.

3. Assess Residual Normality
After winsorizing, evaluate how well the residuals conform to a normal distribution:

Use Q-Q plots to visually inspect normality.
Perform normality tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, or Jarque-Bera) to quantify how close the residuals are to normality.
If the residuals are still highly non-normal, consider alternative adjustments (e.g., robust regression methods).

4. Tailoring Winsorization to Your Data
The exact level of winsorization depends on your dataset's characteristics:

Heavy-tailed distributions: If your data exhibits extreme kurtosis or skewness, more aggressive winsorization (e.g., 5th and 95th percentiles) may be necessary.
Moderate outliers: If the data is reasonably well-behaved with only a few outliers, mild winsorization (e.g., 1st and 99th percentiles) could suffice.
Plot a histogram or kernel density estimate (KDE) of your data to visually determine how extreme the tails are.
