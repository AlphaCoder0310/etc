Presentation
- overnight delta hedging
- Market maker -> inventory risk / ideally no inventory by eod of day
- Don’t want to take overnight risk / gap risk, our edge comes from market making activity during the day
- To achieve that we usually hedge before close or at close during auction
- To evaluate the hedge at end of day and assess whether further hedging using index futures is required for excess market risk
- Hedge effectiveness 
- R2 
- Optimal contract
- Real use cases 

Script
- Hi team, today I would like to give an update on the Overnight Delta Hedging project.
- This project aims to assess and improve our existing end-of-day delta hedging process to better protect against overnight delta risk.

Background and context
- For some background and context, as a market making desk, we provide liquidity and naturally build inventory positions, exposing us to risks like delta and Vega
- So large long or short delta positions can lead to significant losses from adverse price movements, especially during a rally or selloff or after major economic event
- Which is why to manage this, we perform dynamic intraday hedging as well as end-of-day hedging to mitigate the remaining delta risk

Objectives of the project
- The objective of this project is to evaluate the remaining market risk exposure of the end-of-day hedged portfolio
- And to determine the optimal number of futures contracts to buy or sell to mitigate any remaining market risks, taking futures as proxies for the market

- To achieve this objective, I built a model to evaluate how well futures returns can explain and hedge the overnight portfolio’s returns

Below are the key model and backtested outputs
- (1) The model calculates the Beta to measure the portfolio’s sensitivity to market movements.
    - Magnitude: the size of beta indicates the portfolio’s sensitivity to market changes
        - Beta +1.2 the portfolio is expected to increase by 1.2% if the market market increases by 1%
    - Sign: the sign of beta indicates the direction of the portfolio’s relationship with the market
        - +Ve same direction
    - Which are also used to calculate the optimal number of futures contract hedge based on this formula
- (2) It also uses the R2 coefficient
    - Interpreted as how much of the portfolio’s return variance can be explained by futures
    - As well as the proportion of systematic or diversifiable market risk in the portfolio vs unsystematic risks
    - It is performed on individuals stocks and averaged (weighted average)
- (3) hedge effectiveness
    - Hedge effectiveness, calculated through backtesting, evaluates how well the model's optimal hedging strategy reduced overnight delta risk
    - This metric provides a practical measure of how well the hedging model performs in real-world conditions.

How to interpret the model outputs
1. Low R2 coefficient
    1. The model is not good at explaining the portfolio's returns.
Possible reasons include:
    * Significant idiosyncratic risk (specific risk unrelated to the market).
    * Poor choice of the market proxy (e.g., using an index or futures that don't align well with portfolio exposures).
    * Nonlinear or unstable relationships between the portfolio and the hedging instrument.

1. Medium to High R2 Coefficient + High hedge effectiveness
    1. Indicates that the portfolio’s returns are strongly influenced by market risk (systematic risk), and the model successfully captures this relationship.
    2. Futures or other hedging instruments can effectively reduce the residual market risk because there is a significant portion of market risk left to hedge.
2. Medium to high R2 coefficient + low hedge effectiveness
This can happen in long-short portfolios where:
    * Market risks cancel out due to balanced long and short positions, leaving little residual market risk to hedge.
    1. Even though the model accurately captures the relationship between individual stocks and the market (as reflected by a high R²), the portfolio itself has low market exposure, leading to low hedge effectiveness.
1. In this case, the portfolio is already naturally hedged against market risk.

Practical use cases
1. Failed closing auction order
    1. Quantifies how well the hedge mitigates unexpected overnight market risk after failing to execute orders during the closing auction
2. Double checking a well-hedged portfolio
    1. Verifies that the hedging strategy effectively neutralizes market risk and identifies any residual market risks.

Practical Considerations for Hedging
1. Highly Correlated Hedge Instruments:
    1. HSI, HSCE, and HSTECH are highly correlated, causing high factor loadings (large positive/negative Betas cancel out, resulting in a small net effect).
2. Mitigation with ridge regression
    1. Ridge regression adds a penalization term to reduce extreme coefficients but cannot fully resolve the issue..
3. Further mitigation with selection model and practical considerations
    1. The selection model is an optimization process evaluates combinations of 3, 2, or 1 hedge instrument and selects the best based on:
        1. Hedge Effectiveness: Measures reduction in market risk.
        2. R² Coefficient: Ensures the model explains portfolio-market relationships.
        3. Minimal Adjustments: Reduces transaction costs by limiting changes to existing futures positions.
    2. The model balances risk reduction and cost efficiency to identify the most effective hedging strategy.

Future Improvements and Extensions
1. Market Regimes: Test hedge performance in uptrend, downtrend, and ranging markets.
2. Exponential Smoothing: Assign greater weights to recent observations for better responsiveness.
3. Foundation for Other Projects: Enable strategies like intraday lead-lag to address residual (non-market) risks.



- Inventory limits -> set strict limits on the size of inventory they are allowed to hold, reducing exposure to large, risky positions
