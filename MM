Full Strategy Summary: Proactive Charging Against Toxic Counterparty Unwind
1. Track Counterparty Inventory and Entry Price
	• Continuously monitor the toxic counterparty’s position as a percentage of their limit (inventory %).
	• Record their entry price when they accumulate a high inventory (e.g., ≥ 90%).

2. Monitor Spot Movement After Entry
	• Calculate spot movement from the counterparty’s entry price.
	• If the spot moves favorably for the counterparty by a threshold (e.g., +2% from entry for a long position), prepare for potential unwind.

3. Charging Logic (Adaptive Market Making)
	• Start charging (“charge active”) under either condition: 
		○ The spot has moved favorably since entry and inventory is still high (proactive charging).
		○ Inventory starts to unwind (drops below 100% but remains above a lower threshold, e.g., 30%).
	• While charging: Widen your quoted spread, reduce liquidity, or adjust pricing to protect yourself from anticipated toxic flow.

4. Stop Charging
	• Cease charging when the counterparty’s inventory falls below the large unwind threshold (e.g., ≤ 30%) or goes flat (0%).
	• Reset entry price for the next cycle.

5. Adaptive Thresholds
Purpose:
Market conditions change—volatile or illiquid markets require different thresholds for detecting unwinds or deciding when to charge.
How to implement:
	• Volatility-based: Calculate rolling standard deviation of returns over a recent window (e.g., last 30 minutes). 
		○ If volatility is high, increase your unwind/charging threshold to avoid false positives.
	• Liquidity-based: Use rolling traded volume or order book depth. 
		○ If liquidity is low, lower your threshold (since even small unwinds can move the market).
Benefit:
Prevents overreacting in calm markets and underreacting in turbulent ones.

2. Inventory-weighted Signals
Purpose:
Not all unwinds are equal. A large inventory change is more “toxic” than a small one.
How to implement:
	• Signal strength: 
		○ signal_strength = abs(inventory_change) / adaptive_threshold
	• Market making response: 
		○ Scale your spread widening, order size reduction, or fee markup in proportion to signal_strength.

Benefit:
Responds proportionally to risk, maximizing P&L protection and market edge.

3. Lead-Lag Detection
Purpose:
If you track multiple counterparties, unwinds by one may lead unwinds by others. Capturing this effect allows you to anticipate larger moves.
How to implement:
	• Cross-correlation: 
		○ Find if inventory changes in one counterparty statistically precede changes in others.
	• Event-driven aggregation: 
		○ When a “leader” unwinds, watch for a “laggard” to follow within a short period.

5. Visualization & Backtesting
Purpose:
You need to see and test your logic before using real money.
How to implement:
	• Plot: 
		○ Counterparty inventories, spot price, charging signals, and unwind events over time.
	• Backtest: 
		○ Replay historical data, simulate your logic, and track P&L, hit rate, drawdowns.

Summary Table
Enhancement	Why It Matters	Example Implementation
Adaptive Thresholds	Responds to volatility/liquidity changes	Use rolling stddev, volume
Inventory-Weighted	Stronger signals = stronger response	Scale spread/order size by signal
Lead-Lag Detection	Anticipate cascading counterparty flows	Cross-correlation, event aggregation
Machine Learning	Capture complex patterns, improve edge	Train classifier on labeled events
Visualization/BT	Tune, validate, and understand strategy	Plot signals, run simulation

Key Takeaways
	• Be proactive: Start adjusting your market making before the unwind if the spot moves in the counterparty’s favor.
	• Be adaptive: Use inventory levels, spot movement, and volatility/liquidity to dynamically manage your exposure.
	• Be responsive: Cancel extra protection once the risk is gone (after large unwind).

Practical Recommendation for Your Use Case
	• Start with: 
		○ Avellaneda-Stoikov for quoting and inventory management.
		○ Random Forest or XGBoost for toxicity/unwind prediction (easy to implement, robust to feature selection).
		○ Backtest inventory-weighted, volatility-adaptive quoting logic.
