Fed 

Weak nfp print and major downward revisions make a Sep cut very likely 

Rates 

Citi removes US rates hedges 

Shifts US duration in GAA back to neutral 

Reiterates steepeners (expecting yield curve to steepen as Fed cuts rates) and stays short USD, both in GAA and GMS (Global Macro Strategy). 

USD outlook 

HF are now max long UDS, risks of a squeeze or reversal are high 

Citi stays short USD 

Equities and US Capex Boom 

Despite weak labour data, US capex (AI / data centres)  is booming and likely to continue, support equity upside 

Equities are not overly forward-looking in capex booms; still room for more upside. 

Remains long US equities, especially NDX/SPW (Nasdaq 100/S&P equal weight). 

Cuts EM Asia overweight (tax headwinds in Korea) and halves UK underweight to keep overall equity overweight at +1. 

Japan 

BoJ cautious, no early hike 

Citi remains paid 1y1y JPY 

Position in interest rate derivatives market 

1y1y: A swap starting in 1y lasting 1y 

Piad: in IRS, "pay fixed" means Citi is paying a fixed rate and receiving a floating rate 

JPY: japense interest rate 

Citi is betting that JPY rate will rise in the period between one and two years from now. 

Citi is taking steps to limit risk from its main position 

Oct OIS receiver 

OIS: overnight index swap, a derivative tied to short term interest rates 

Receiver: gets a fixed rate and pays float 

To offset some of the rsik of their main position, Citi is taking an opposite position around October 

Summary 

The Bank of Japan is not expected to raise interest rates soon. 

Citi is positioned for higher Japanese rates in the future (specifically, they benefit if rates rise between 1 and 2 years from now), but 

To protect themselves if rates stay lower in the near term (especially around October), Citi is hedging by taking a position that benefits if rates do not rise (or even fall) short-term. 

Risks 

Fed could delay cuts if inflation rebounds 

EM Asia risks: Korea tax reforms, India tariffs 

Sentiment 

Equity sentiment not frothy despite high prices; no warning signs from positioning or investor surveys 

Buying market highs not especially risky over 1-3m holding periods. 

Macro themes 

US capex boom (AI/data centers) continues to drive GDP and equity leadership. 

Trade deals (US-China, US-EU, US-Japan) lack detail/guarantees, not clearly USD-positive. 

Tariffs: Some drag, but offset by capex and tariff clarity. 

Bottom Line (Citi’s Current House View) 

September Fed cut is now base case. 

USD short 

Equities: Overweight (focus US, NDX/SPW, cut EM Asia), underweight credit 

Rates: neutral duration, favor steepeners 

Central banks: pay JPY 1y1y, hedge with Oct OIS 

 

Citi US Economics 

Fed outlook 

Softer labour market, given weak jobs data and rising unemployment 

Citi expects 25bp cuts to resume in September, with a cut at each meeting until March 2026, reaching a terminal Fed funds rate of 3.00–3.25%. 

Risks: Faster and/or deeper cuts possible (e.g., a 50bp cut in September), depending on incoming data. 

Layoffs 

Layoffs still limited: Initial jobless claims remain low, but Challenger layoff announcements did tick up in July. 

Watch jobless claims for early warning signs of a rise in layoffs. 

Consumer spending & Growth 

Underlying demand is softening: Final private domestic demand rose just 1.2%, slowest since 2022, masked by headline GDP (boosted by falling imports). 

Consumer spending is slowing, especially in services; goods spending volatile due to tariff front-loading. 

Savings rate is already low. 

Inflation 

Core PCE inflation was 0.26% MoM, but prior months were revised up; YoY now 2.8%. 

Core PCE inflation:  

PCE stands for Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. 

Core means it excludes food and energy prices, which can be volatile. 

0.26% MoM:  

MoM = month over month. 

Prices increased by 0.26% in the most recent month. 

Prior months were revised up:  

Earlier estimates for previous months’ inflation were adjusted higher. 

Citi expects inflation to pick up in July/August, but as long as it’s contained in goods and not too strong, the Fed will proceed with cuts. 

As long as it’s contained in goods and not too strong:  

If the rise is mainly in goods prices (not services) and isn’t too large, it’s less concerning. 

Market reaction 

Markets had priced out 2025 cuts after Powell’s FOMC, but the weak jobs data reversed sentiment quickly. 

2-year Treasury yields fell from 3.95% to 3.70%. 

S&P 500 fell 2.4% on the week, hurt by jobs data and new tariffs. 

Outlook 

Fed speakers next week may sound more dovish in response to the data. 

Labor market data (ISM Services, jobless claims) will be closely watched by markets for further signs of weakness. 

New tariffs take effect August 7th, but could still see last-minute deals. 

Summary 

 

Topic 

Citi View (Aug 2025) 

Fed Policy 

25bp cut in September, then cuts at every meeting to 3.00–3.25% 

Risks 

Faster/deeper cuts possible (e.g., 50bp in Sep) 

Labor Market 

Clear softening: weak payrolls, rising unemployment 

Participation 

Falling; foreign-born labor force share declining 

Wages 

No acceleration; leisure/hospitality wage growth weak 

Layoffs 

Still low, but a risk if hiring remains weak 

Inflation 

Slight pickup expected, but not enough to stop cuts if contained 

Markets 

Reacted sharply to jobs data; yields down, equities down 

 

8. Bottom line 

Citi expects the Fed to resume rate cuts in September, with a series of cuts to a terminal rate of 3.00–3.25%. This call is supported by broad labor market weakness, softening growth, and limited inflation risk. Citi sees the risks tilted toward even faster or deeper easing if the data deteriorate further.
