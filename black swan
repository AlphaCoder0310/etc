Summary: HSI Black Swan Event & CBBC Performance Context
Extreme Market Move:
In April, we experienced an 11% overnight move in the HSI—statistically, a “once in hundreds of years” event (assuming normal volatility), or “once in tens of years” when accounting for fat tails. Empirically, such moves have occurred only about once every three decades.

Profit Path & Drawdown:
Most of our CBBC profits were generated from January to April. The black swan event erased a sizable portion, yet we remained above water by 500k immediately after, reflecting prudent risk management and positive edge prior to the shock.

Recovery & Model Accuracy:
When asked about recovery, I estimated 1.5–2.5 months—a timeframe based on both historical P&L rebound rates and regime expectations. We did, in fact, recover the drawdown within this window, validating both our model and process discipline.

Significant Growth:
The CBBC strategy’s contribution to desk P&L grew from 5% to 20–25%, marking a step-change in its importance and demonstrating both scalability and potential for future profit, especially given the overall desk growth.

Conclusion:
Despite a true black swan event, the CBBC strategy showed resilience, rapid recovery, and significant growth in desk contribution. This reinforces its value and future potential as a profit driver, provided that tail risks continue to be managed and monitored prudently.
