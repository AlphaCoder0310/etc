Introduction
* Hi team, today I’d like provide an update on the Overnight Delta Hedging project.
* This project aims to assess and improve our end-of-day delta hedging process to better protect against overnight delta risk.

Background and Context
* As a market-making desk, we provide liquidity, naturally building inventory positions that expose us to delta and Vega risks.
* Large delta positions, if unhedged, can lead to significant losses especially during events like market rallies, selloffs, or major economic announcements.
* To manage this, we perform dynamic intraday hedging as well as end-of-day hedging to reduce delta risk.

Objectives of the Project
* Evaluate the remaining market risk in the end-of-day hedged portfolio.
* Determine the optimal number of futures contracts to buy/sell to mitigate residual market risks
    * Why futures, because it often used as market proxies
    * It trades after trading hours
* Which is achieved by building a model to measure how well futures returns hedge the portfolio’s overnight returns.

Key Model and Backtested Outputs
1. Beta Coefficient:
    * Measures portfolio sensitivity to market movements.
        * Magnitude: Beta +1.2 means a 1% market increase leads to a 1.2% portfolio increase.
        * Sign: Indicates direction (+ve = same direction, -ve = opposite).
    * Used to calculate the optimal hedge ratio for futures contracts.
2. R² Coefficient:
    * Explains how much of the portfolio’s return variance is due to the market (systematic risk).
    * Highlights the split between systematic (hedgeable) and idiosyncratic (non-hedgeable) risks.
    * Calculated for individual stocks and averaged 
    * improvement -> (weighted by portfolio weight).
3. Hedge Effectiveness:
    * Backtested to evaluate how well the hedge reduced overnight delta risk.
    * Provides a practical measure of the model’s real-world performance.

How to Interpret Model Outputs
1. Low R² Coefficient:
    * Indicates poor model performance due to:
        * Significant idiosyncratic risk.
        * Poor market proxy or nonlinear relationships.
2. Medium to High R² + High Hedge Effectiveness:
    * The portfolio heavily influenced by market risk, and the hedge effectively reduces residual market risk because there is a significant portion of market risk left to hedge.
3. Medium to High R² + Low Hedge Effectiveness:
This can happen in long-short portfolios where:
    * Market risks cancel out due to balanced long and short positions, leaving little residual market risk to hedge
    * Portfolio is naturally hedged

Practical / Live Use Cases
1. Failed Closing Auction Order:
    * Quantifies how well the hedge mitigates unexpected overnight risk if orders fail to execute.
2. Double-Checking a Well-Hedged Portfolio:
    * Verifies hedge effectiveness and identifies any residual risks.

Practical Considerations
1. Highly Correlated Hedge Instruments:
    * HSI, HSCE, and HSTECH are highly correlated, leading to high factor loadings, where large positive/negative Betas cancel out, making the net effect small .
2. Mitigation with Ridge Regression:
    * Adds a penalty to reduce extreme coefficients, stabilizing the model, though not fully resolving the issue.
3. Selection Model and Optimization:
The model evaluates combinations of 3, 2, or 1 hedge instruments and selects the best based on:
    * Hedge Effectiveness: Risk reduction.
    * R² Coefficient: Statistical reliability.
    * Minimal Adjustments: Lower transaction costs.

    - Balances risk reduction and cost efficiency for the best hedging strategy.

Future Improvements and Extensions
1. Market Regimes: Test performance in uptrend, downtrend, and ranging markets. (Side Note: Ensures robustness across different market conditions.)
2. Exponential Smoothing: Weight recent observations more heavily for better responsiveness. (Side Note: Improves responsiveness to changing market dynamics.)
3. Foundation for Other Projects: Supports strategies like intraday lead-lag to address residual risks. (Side Note: Builds on this foundation for broader applications.)

Summary for Presentation
* Objective: Improve the end-of-day delta hedging process to better mitigate overnight delta risk using futures as market proxies.
* Key Model Outputs:
    1. Beta Coefficient: Measures portfolio sensitivity to market movements and calculates the optimal hedge ratio.
    2. R² Coefficient: Explains how much of the portfolio’s risk is market-driven (systematic) vs idiosyncratic.
    3. Hedge Effectiveness: Assesses how well the hedge reduces overnight risk, tested via backtesting.
* Practical Considerations:
    * Challenges: Correlated hedge instruments (HSI, HSCE, HSTECH) may result in high factor loadings.
    * Mitigation: Use ridge regression and a selection model to optimize hedge combinations while balancing effectiveness, R², and transaction costs.
* Use Cases:
    1. Handling failed closing auction orders.
    2. Verifying hedge effectiveness in well-hedged portfolios.
* Future Improvements:
    1. Test performance across different market regimes (uptrend, downtrend, ranging).
    2. Use exponential smoothing to prioritize recent data.
    3. Extend to other strategies like intraday lead-lag for residual risk management.
This project strengthens risk management and lays the foundation for broader hedging and trading strategies.
