Problem recap 

Vol management 

Vol mode 

Margin mode 

Issue 

Charging vol decreases over time "decay in vol margin" 

Vega-bleed 

Arbitrageurs buy at a high vol margin 

 

Vol Margin Decay Trap 

When your vol margin decays, the product becomes very cheap (low implied vol). 

This is great for both arbitrageurs and retail buyers (they get cheap vol), but it’s bad for you as the seller, because you’re not earning enough for the risk you’re warehousing. 

If you try to raise the price (vol margin), the arbitrageurs will unwind, possibly at your expense 

 

No-Win Situation 

Cheap for all buyers, bad for you 

Raising margin triggers arbitrageur unwind risk 

Continue to sell cheap increase my risk and potential losses 

 

Algorithmic Solutions and Business Rules 

Set a minimum vol margin floor -> mix of outstanding + competitors' price 

Never let your margin decay below your minimum risk-adjusted threshold, unless there is a high outstanding 

Accept that sometimes you will be out of the market if competitors go below this level  

Inventory-weighted decay (existing risk) 

If your inventory is large or risk is high, slow or pause the decay 

Tiered quoting / size limits 

Offer small sizes at the decayed margin (to stay in the market, but cap your risk) 

Widen spreads or increase margin for larger trades 

Event-driven margin reset 

Reset or increase margin only after a significant unwind or after arbitrageur positions roll off 

Don’t reset margin while arbitrageurs are still long your product 

Balance the risk to rewards (potential new flow vs unwinds) 

Dynamic flow segmentation 

Identify and treat retail and arbitrageurs flows differently
