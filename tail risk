Extreme HSI Event, Exceptional Resilience:
In April, HSI experienced an 11% overnight move—a black swan event statistically expected only once in hundreds of years, or every few decades even with fat tails. Empirically, this is a once-in-30-years event.

Strong Track Record Before the Shock:
Most CBBC profits were made January to April. Even after the black swan, our CBBC net P&L was still up by 500k, showing real edge and prudent risk management.

Rapid, Predictable Recovery:
When asked about the loss, I estimated recovery in 1.5–2.5 months based on our models. We achieved this, fully recovering within that timeframe—demonstrating both discipline and strategy reliability.

Significant P&L Growth:
CBBCs’ share of desk P&L grew from 5% to 20–25%. This is a substantial shift, highlighting scalability and growing business importance.

Profit vs. Tail Risk Perspective:
If just a few months of profit can cover a move that statistically happens only once every several years or decades, this shows just how strong the risk-adjusted return of our CBBC business is.

Strategic Next Steps:
Given this resilience and profitability, it’s clear we should continue to push 1810 CBBCs. At the same time, it’s worth exploring CBBCs on other major names to match competition from other issuers and further expand our market share.

Bottom line:
Despite facing an extremely rare market shock, CBBCs proved resilient, quickly rebounded, and are now a major driver of the desk’s growth. This track record, combined with their risk-adjusted return profile, makes CBBCs well worth renewed focus and distribution.
