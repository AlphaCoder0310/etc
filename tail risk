Extreme HSI Event, Exceptional Resilience:
In April, HSI experienced an 11% overnight move—a black swan event statistically expected only once in hundreds of years, or every few decades even with fat tails. Empirically, this is a once-in-30-years event.

Strong Track Record Before the Shock:
Most CBBC profits were made January to April. Even after the black swan, our CBBC net P&L was still up by 500k, showing real edge and prudent risk management.

Rapid, Predictable Recovery:
When asked about the loss, I estimated recovery in 1.5–2.5 months based on our models. We achieved this, fully recovering within that timeframe—demonstrating both discipline and strategy reliability.

Significant P&L Growth (Growth Perspective):
While stock CBBCs’ contribution to overall desk P&L is still relatively modest in absolute terms, it has grown rapidly—from 5% to 20–25%. This substantial shift highlights strong momentum, scalability, and the growing business importance of CBBCs. From a growth perspective, this is a clear area of opportunity.

Profit vs. Tail Risk Perspective:
If just a few months of profit can cover a move that statistically happens only once every several years or decades, this shows just how strong the risk-adjusted return of our CBBC business is.

PNL Measurement—Why Realised PNL Matters:
We track pnlTR (realised profit) as our core performance measure because it captures closed, locked-in gains—making it a more reliable indicator of true performance than eqrmsPnl, which includes unrealised, potentially volatile swings.

Tail Risk vs. Profit Coverage:
Tail risk events do happen more often than theory suggests. But even if another 10% overnight move happened tomorrow (per our stress tests: a 1mil loss), we would still be up 500k—demonstrating the robustness of our approach and the ability to withstand repeated shocks.

Strategic Next Steps:
Given this resilience and profitability, it’s clear we should continue to push 1810 CBBCs. At the same time, it’s worth exploring CBBCs on other major names to match competition from other issuers and further expand our market share.

Bottom line:
Despite facing an extremely rare market shock, CBBCs proved resilient, quickly rebounded, and are now a major driver of the desk’s growth. This track record, combined with their risk-adjusted return profile, makes CBBCs well worth renewed focus and distribution.
