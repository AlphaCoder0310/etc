To give higher weight to the most recent data while fitting a linear regression model, you can use a weighted least squares (WLS) regression approach, where recent observations are assigned higher weights. One effective way to assign weights is by using Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) or similar exponential decay functions. Here's how you can accomplish this:

1. Using EWMA to Assign Weights
EWMA Formula:
The weights for EWMA decrease exponentially as you move further back in time. The formula for the weight at time 
𝑡
t is:

𝑤
𝑡
=
(
1
−
𝜆
)
⋅
𝜆
𝑇
−
𝑡
w 
t
​
 =(1−λ)⋅λ 
T−t
 
Where:

𝑤
𝑡
w 
t
​
 : Weight for the 
𝑡
t-th observation.
𝜆
λ: Smoothing factor (0 < 
𝜆
λ < 1). A higher 
𝜆
λ gives more importance to recent data.
𝑇
T: Total number of observations.
𝑡
t: Index of the observation (more recent data has higher 
𝑡
t).
Steps:
Choose a value for 
𝜆
λ (e.g., 0.9 for moderate decay or closer to 1 for stronger emphasis on recent data).
Compute weights 
𝑤
𝑡
w 
t
​
  for all 60 observations using the formula above.
Normalize the weights so that they sum up to 1 (optional but helps with interpretability):
𝑤
𝑡
=
𝑤
𝑡
∑
𝑖
=
1
𝑇
𝑤
𝑖
w 
t
​
 = 
∑ 
i=1
T
​
 w 
i
​
 
w 
t
​
 
​
 
Use these weights in a weighted least squares regression instead of ordinary least squares.
2. Implement Weighted Least Squares
In WLS, each observation is weighted by the 
𝑤
𝑡
w 
t
​
  calculated above. The objective function for WLS minimizes the weighted sum of squared errors:

Minimize: 
∑
𝑡
=
1
𝑇
𝑤

⋅
(

Minimize:  
t=1
∑
T
​
 w 
t
​
 ⋅(y

​
 −

​

 )

Most statistical packages (e.g., Python's statsmodels, R's lm with weights, etc.) allow you to specify weights when fitting a regression model.

Python Example (Using statsmodels):
python

Copy
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Example Data
n = 60  # Number of observations
X = np.random.rand(n, 1)  # Independent variable
y = 3 * X.squeeze() + np.random.randn(n)  # Dependent variable with noise

# Add a constant term for the regression intercept
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Calculate EWMA weights
lambda_ = 0.9  # Smoothing factor
weights = np.array([(1 - lambda_) * (lambda_ ** (n - t)) for t in range(1, n + 1)])

# Fit Weighted Least Squares (WLS)
wls_model = sm.WLS(y, X, weights=weights)
results = wls_model.fit()

# Summary of results
print(results.summary())
3. Alternative: Polynomial or Linear Decay Weights
If you prefer a simpler weighting scheme instead of an exponential decay, you can use linear decay or polynomial decay to assign weights.

Linear Decay:
Weights decrease linearly as you move back in time:

𝑤
𝑡
=
𝑡
𝑇
w 
t
​
 = 
T
t
​
 
Where 
𝑡
t is the index of the observation, and 
𝑇
T is the total number of observations.

Polynomial Decay:
Weights decrease polynomially:

𝑤
𝑡
=
1
𝑡
𝑝
w 
t
​
 = 
t 
p
 
1
​
 
Where 
𝑝
p controls the rate of decay.

These weights can then be normalized and used in the same way as the EWMA weights in WLS regression.

4. Why Use EWMA?
Smooth Decay: Exponential decay ensures a smooth drop in weights, which is often more realistic for time series data.
Flexibility: By adjusting 
𝜆
λ, you can control how much emphasis is placed on recent data.
Robustness: EWMA is widely used in time series analysis and financial modeling because it adapts well to changing trends.
5. Summary
To give higher weights to recent data in a regression model:

Use EWMA: Calculate exponentially decaying weights with a chosen smoothing factor 
𝜆
λ.
Fit WLS Regression: Use the weights in a weighted least squares regression.
Alternative Weights: Consider linear or polynomial decay if exponential decay doesn't suit your needs.
This approach ensures that your regression model prioritizes recent data, making it more responsive to recent trends.

To assign higher weights to more recent observations in your 60-day regression model, here are two practical approaches:

Using exponential weights:
python

Copy
import numpy as np

# Generate exponential weights for 60 observations
decay_factor = 0.97  # Adjust this between 0 and 1 
weights = np.array([decay_factor**i for i in range(60)])[::-1]
weights = weights / weights.sum()  # Normalize weights to sum to 1

# Use in weighted least squares regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y, sample_weight=weights)
Using EWMA-style weights:
python

Copy
# EWMA-style weights
span = 30  # Adjust this to control decay speed
alpha = 2/(span + 1)
weights = np.array([(1-alpha)**i for i in range(60)])[::-1]
weights = weights / weights.sum()

# Use in weighted least squares regression
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y, sample_weight=weights)
